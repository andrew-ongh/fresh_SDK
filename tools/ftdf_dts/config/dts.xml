Scripts which are not to be used in regression are:

<script>scripts/evaluation/acknowledgment/LD02_Acknowledgment_FR4450_FR4500.py</script> 
    - The purpose of this script is to send an ack frame transparently. Since the ack is very time critical,
      this script will almost always fail because it cannot send the transparent message from the Python environment
      to the device within the required time.

<script>scripts/evaluation/csl/LD02_CSL_channel.py</script>
    - This script was made to test CSL channel hopping. However, during implementation it was decided that CSL 
      channel hopping was not to be implemented in the MAC. Therefore, this script is declared invalid.

<script>scripts/evaluation/other/LD03_aTurnaroundTime_FR1220_FR1330.py</script>
    - This script is used to test if the MAC conforms to the aTurnaroundTime constant in respect to the
      time between a CCA and the transmission of a frame. This can only be tested by using a logic analyzer.
      Therefore, this is not a regression test.

<script>scripts/evaluation/security/LD02_Security_FR3600.py</script>
    - There is a limitation in DTS of the number of device tables, security tables and key tables.
      Due to this limitation, this requirement cannot be tested in the regression test.

<script>scripts/evaluation/TSCH/LD03_tsch_FR6200_FR6280.py</script>
    - This script is used to manually test the correct value of the ASN in frames. This must be done with
      a logic analyzer. Therefore, this is not a regression test.

<script>scripts/evaluation/TSCH/LD03_tsch_FR6320.py</script>
    - This script is used to manually test the phy states during empty links. This must be done with
      a logic analyzer. Therefore, this is not a regression test.

<script>scripts/evaluation/TSCH/LD03_tsch_synch.py</script>
    - This script is used to test the durability of the TSCH timekeeping functionality of the UMAC.
      This durability test runs for approximately 3 days, therefore it is not suited for use in regression.

<script>scripts/evaluation/other/LD02_CCA.py</script>
<script>scripts/evaluation/TSCH/LD03_tsch_CCA.py</script>
    - These scripts used to test CHANNEL_ACCESS_FAILURE results by using dummy DPHY registers.
      With the radio module, these scripts can no longer succeed since the radio does allow
      for CCA failure faking.
