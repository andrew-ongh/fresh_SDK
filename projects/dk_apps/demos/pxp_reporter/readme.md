Proximity Reporter demo application {#pxp}
===================================

## Overview

This application is a sample implementation of Proximity Reporter as defined
by Proximity Profile (https://developer.bluetooth.org/TechnologyOverview/Pages/PXP.aspx).

It supports the mandatory Link Loss Service and both optional Immediate Alert and Tx Power Services.

Features:

- Advertising is started automatically once application is started

- Alerting is done using white LED available on ProDK:

 * for medium alert level LED blinks at slow rate
 * for high alert level LED blinks at fast rate

- For LLS, alert is automatically disabled after 15 seconds of inactivity or
  upon reconnection of client which lost connection

- Tx Power Level is hardcoded to static value

- Device name can be read from flash

- Application supports software update over the air; for details look at [SUOTA in Proximity Reporter](@ref pxp_suota) document

## Installation procedure

The project is located in the \b `projects/dk_apps/demos/pxp_reporter` folder.

To install the project follow the [General Installation and Debugging Procedure](@ref install_and_debug_procedure).

## Suggested Configurable parameters

- Default device name
  In pxp_reporter_config.h, put the device name in PX_REPORTER_DEFAULT_NAME macro

- Advertising Interval
  In pxp_reporter_task.c, set the adverting interval in lines 69-83 (adv_intervals[]).

- Alert Actions (use the alert callbacks in pxp_reporter_task.c):
 * ias_alert_cb
 * lls_alert_cb

## PTS testing

Application can be readily used for executing PTS test cases against LLS, IAS and TPS.
It does not require any user intervention during testing.

## Manual testing

- build the demo for execution from flash
- download to flash and execute
- write device name to flash at address 0x80019 preceded by two bytes of its length (optional)
- scan for the device by name "Dialog PX Reporter" and connect
- write value to Alert Level characteristic in Immediate Alert service:

 * 0x00 (No alert) - the white LED on ProDK device does not blink
 * 0x01 (Mild alert) - the white LED on ProDK blinks slow immediately
 * 0x02 (High Alert) - the white LED on ProDK blinks fast immediately
 
- write value to Alert Level characteristic in Link Loss service:

 * 0x00 (No alert) - the white LED on ProDK device does not blink
 * 0x01 (Mild alert) - the white LED on ProDK blinks slow after link loss
 * 0x02 (High Alert) - the white LED on ProDK blinks fast after link loss
 * to trigger link loss event put Android/Apple device in RF Shield box or significantly increase
   the distance between the two devices

- read value of Tx Power Level characteristic in Tx Power service:
 * at each reading should be given the same value (0 dBm hardcoded in application)
